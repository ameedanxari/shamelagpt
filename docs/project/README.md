# Project Operations Docs

This folder contains project-tracking and execution handoff documents that were previously stored at the repository root.

## Status
- `status/MY_PROJECT.md`
- `status/NEXT_ACTION.md`
- `status/EXECUTION_PROGRESS.md`
- `status/FINAL_STATUS_REPORT.md`

Use these for internal planning and execution tracking. Product and engineering documentation remains under other `docs/` sections.
