    "full_answer": "Islam, as understood in Islamic tradition, carries a multi-faceted meaning, encompassing both a state of being and a set of fundamental practices. It is the religion chosen by Allah for His servants, and no other religion is accepted from anyone (Document: 22_27107_17324_0).\n\n## Meaning of Islam\n\nIslam's core meaning is the \"submission to Allah (God) Almighty through monotheism, obeying Him, and being free from polytheism\" (Document: 22_27107_17379, 22_27107_17324_0). It is considered one of the three ranks of religion, alongside Iman (faith) and Ihsan (excellence) (Document: 22_27107_17379, 22_27107_17324_0).\n\nThe term \"Islam\" can have two contexts:\n\n*   **When paired with Iman (faith):** In this context, Islam refers specifically to the outward actions and deeds, while Iman refers to the inward beliefs (Document: 22_27107_17379, 22_27107_17324_0). An example is the Hadith of Gabriel, where Islam's pillars are listed as external acts, and Iman's pillars are listed as internal beliefs.\n*   **When mentioned alone:** If the term \"Islam\" is used independently, its meaning becomes comprehensive, encompassing both the outward actions and the inward beliefs (Document: 22_27107_17379, 22_27107_17324_0). In this broader sense, it includes belief in Allah, His angels, His books, His messengers, and so on. This is reflected in verses like \"Indeed, the religion in the sight of Allah is Islam\" (Quran 3:19) (Document: 22_27107_17379, 22_27107_17324_0).\n\n## Pillars of Islam (Arkan al-Islam)\n\nThe practical foundation of Islam is built upon five fundamental pillars. These are explicitly stated in the well-known Hadith of Gabriel, narrated by Umar (may Allah be pleased with him), where the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) defined Islam (Document: 22_27107_17379, 22_27107_17324_0, 1_18338_42_0, 1_30800_4_1). These pillars represent the essential duties and practices that a Muslim must uphold:\n\n*   **1. Shahadatayn (The Two Testimonies of Faith):**\n    *   To bear witness that \"there is no god but Allah\" (La ilaha illa Allah) and \"Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah\" (Muhammadur Rasul Allah) (Document: 22_27107_17379, 22_27107_17324_0, 1_18338_42_0, 1_30800_4_1).\n    *   This testimony is considered the \"pillar of beliefs\" (Document: 1_18338_42_0), affirming the absolute oneness of God and the finality of Prophet Muhammad's prophethood.\n\n*   **2. Iqamat al-Salat (Establishing Prayer):**\n    *   To perform the prescribed ritual prayers (Salat) five times a day (Document: 22_27107_17379, 22_27107_17324_0, 1_18338_42_0, 1_30800_4_1).\n    *   Prayer is described as the \"pillar of direct worship\" (Document: 1_18338_42_0) and is a direct connection between the worshipper and Allah.\n\n*   **3. Itaa' az-Zakat (Giving Zakat):**\n    *   To pay the obligatory charity (Zakat) to those eligible (Document: 22_27107_17379, 22_27107_17324_0, 1_18338_42_0, 1_30800_4_1).\n    *   Zakat is the \"pillar of economic life\" (Document: 1_18338_42_0), purifying wealth and supporting the needy in society.\n\n*   **4. Sawm Ramadan (Fasting in Ramadan):**\n    *   To fast during the month of Ramadan (Document: 22_27107_17379, 22_27107_17324_0, 1_18338_42_0, 1_30800_4_1).\n    *   Fasting is the \"pillar of deeds that control the self upon Allah's command\" (Document: 1_18338_42_0), fostering discipline, empathy, and spiritual reflection.\n\n*   **5. Hajj al-Bayt (Pilgrimage to the House of Allah):**\n    *   To perform the pilgrimage to the Kaaba in Mecca for those who are able (Document: 22_27107_17379, 22_27107_17324_0, 1_18338_42_0, 1_30800_4_1).\n    *   Hajj is considered the \"pillar of political life\" (Document: 1_18338_42_0), symbolizing unity and equality among Muslims from around the world.\n\nThese five pillars serve as the foundation upon which the entire structure of Islam is built, with all other aspects of Islamic life in politics, economics, social relations, and ethics being constructed upon them (Document: 1_18338_42_0).\n\n\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0635\u0627\u062f\u0631 / Sources\n- [\u0641\u062a\u0627\u0648\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0628\u0643\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645\u064a\u0629] - https://shamela.ws/book/27107/17379\n- [\u0645\u062c\u0645\u0648\u0639\u0629 \u0631\u0633\u0627\u0626\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0648\u062c\u064a\u0647\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645\u064a\u0629 \u0644\u0625\u0635\u0644\u0627\u062d \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0631\u062f \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0645\u062c\u062a\u0645\u0639] - https://shamela.ws/book/17392/84\n- [\u0641\u062a\u0627\u0648\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0628\u0643\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645\u064a\u0629] - https://shamela.ws/book/27107/17344\n- [\u0627\u0644\u062a\u0648\u062d\u064a\u062f \u0644\u0644\u0646\u0627\u0634\u0626\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0628\u062a\u062f\u0626\u064a\u0646] - https://shamela.ws/book/30800/6\n- [\u0627\u0644\u0623\u0633\u0627\u0633 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0646\u0629 \u0648\u0641\u0642\u0647\u0647\u0627 - \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0642\u0627\u0626\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645\u064a\u0629] - https://shamela.ws/book/18338/151",
