# Mobile Implementation Tasks (iOS + Android)

**Date**: 2026-02-17
**Scope**: Mobile execution slices for Stage 06 outputs

## iOS Workstream
- [x] **M-IOS-01 (P0)** Normalize critical accessibility identifiers for auth/chat/history/settings.
- [x] **M-IOS-02 (P0)** Refactor critical XCUITests to canonical selectors + deterministic launch setup.
- [x] **M-IOS-03 (P0)** Expand iOS mock scenario matrix for full error/network classes.
- [x] **M-IOS-04 (P1)** Add diagnostics helper coverage in failure-path assertions.
- [x] **M-IOS-05 (P0)** Execute localized smoke (`en/ar/ur`) with RTL-sensitive checks.
- [x] **M-IOS-06 (P1)** Generate and archive iOS coverage/test artifacts.

## Android Workstream
- [x] **M-AND-01 (P0)** Normalize critical Compose test tags/content descriptions for auth/chat/history/settings.
- [x] **M-AND-02 (P0)** Refactor critical instrumentation tests to canonical selectors + deterministic setup.
- [x] **M-AND-03 (P0)** Expand Android mock scenario matrix for full error/network classes.
- [x] **M-AND-04 (P1)** Add diagnostics helper coverage in failure-path assertions.
- [x] **M-AND-05 (P0)** Execute localized smoke (`en/ar/ur`) with RTL-sensitive checks.
- [x] **M-AND-06 (P1)** Generate and archive Android coverage/test artifacts.

## Cross-Platform Parity
- [x] **M-PAR-01 (P0)** Validate selector naming parity map across iOS/Android critical flows.
- [x] **M-PAR-02 (P0)** Validate mock scenario semantic parity across iOS/Android.
- [x] **M-PAR-03 (P1)** Validate localization/RTL assertion parity and document deltas.
- [x] **M-PAR-04 (P1)** Publish mobile batch checkpoint summary and residual gaps.
